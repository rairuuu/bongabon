                <hr>
                <p>Bongabon, located in Nueva Ecija, Philippines, has a history rooted in agriculture. Originally inhabited by Aetas, it became a Spanish encomienda and later gained independence as a municipality in 1902. During World War II, Bongabon served as a guerrilla stronghold. Today, it remains an agricultural center, producing rice, corn, and other crops. The town has seen developments in infrastructure, education, and commerce, while preserving its natural resources. Bongabon continues to strive for sustainable development and a better quality of life for its residents.</p>
                <p>Bongabon, is an old town of Nueva Ecija and was the Second Capital of Nueva Ecija, after Baler, (which is now the capital of Aurora Province). Looking back at History, before the creation of the province of Nueva Ecija in1705, Bongabon was part of the province of Pampanga. During the seventeenth century, 1637 to 1700, the Augustinian missionaries were given the task of establishing missions to bring the Catholic Faith to the people ofCentral and Northern Luzon from Manila to the Pacific coasts. They followed the routesto these part of Luzon along the Pampanga and Santor Rivers. (Santor is at present a barrio of Bongabon). The Missionaries followed the route along the river banks from Bacolor, to Sexmoan, Macabebe, Arayat, Gapan and Santor In 1638. Fray Gaspar Lopez an eminent orator, was brought to a mission of the Augustinian in Santor and Gapang in 1641. Finding Santor to be an ideal site for the headquarters of the missions, they constructed a church and convent in the place. From this base, the missionaries worked for the conversion of the people of Gapang (now Gapan), Pantabangan and Baler. In 1700, the missions were quite successful and they established the village of Bongabon which was three kilometers from Santor.</p>

                <h1>History of Sibuyas Festival</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The first seeds of Sibuyas were introduced and planted onto Bongabon soil in the year 1935, in a homestead in Brgy. Calaanan, by Engineer Lorenzo Ylarde and his wife Maria Cruz. In succeeding years, Ylarde passed away and Maria remarried Dr. Antonio Aves, and together, they continued farming and trading Sibuyas. This marked the beginning of the town’s onion trade, and soon after, other Bongabon families followed their lead  in cultivating and selling Sibuyas in local and international markets. Bongabon became the largest supplier of onions in the Philippines, earning the town its titles as the Onion Capital of the Philippines and the Onion Basket of Asia.</p>
                <p>With this, the Sibuyas Festival of Bongabon, Nueva Ecija was created in 2004, through the collaboration of local culture and arts advocate Armando C. Giron, and then mayor of Bongabon, Hon. Amelia “Beth” A. Gamilla. Gamilla, the daughter of Dr. Antonio and Maria Aves, and Giron, the son of Faustino Giron and Eufrocina Cunanan, also onion traders, believed in the need to create a celebration that paid homage to their ancestors and to the industry that continues to serve as the lifeblood of their beloved town.</p>
